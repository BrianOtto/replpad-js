// This is the "JavaScript side" of the C code implemented in %c-pump.c, whose
// build product is included here as `c-pump-o.js` (see compile.sh for how
// this is built)
//
// Both pieces of the pump are intended to be run inside a "Web Worker", which
// has exclusive access to: any compiled C routines, the emscripten heap, and
// any emscripten APIs for accessing it.  The reason the access is exclusive
// is because JavaScript's web workers are more analogous to different
// "processes" than what people would think of conventionally as "threads":
//
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API
//
// Variables (and even constants) aren't shared between a worker and the
// browser GUI thread that spawned the worker via `new Worker()`.  The threads
// can't mutate each other's objects.  They can only post messages between
// them, where any objects in the message get fully copied.
//
// The GUI is kept free to run events while the C code may not be yielding
// in the web worker.  So the UI won't lock up.  But if the C code doesn't
// yield--even for a moment with a poll request--then there's no way to
// modify state it could observe, and any requests posted to it from the
// GUI could stay queued indefinitely.
//

function queueRequestToGUI(id, str) {
    if (str === undefined)
        str = null  // although `undefined == null`, canonize to null

    // This will eventually run `pump.onmessage` in the code that instantiated
    // the pump worker.  So if that code said:
    //
    //     var pump = Worker('worker.js');
    //     pump.onmessage(function (e) {...});
    //
    // ...this argument to postMessage is the `e.data` that code will receive.
    //
    postMessage([id, str])
}

// This is the routine triggered by the GUI when it does pump.postMessage()
